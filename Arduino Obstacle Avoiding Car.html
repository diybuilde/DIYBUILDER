        An Obstacle Avoidance Robot is an intelligent robot, which can
        automatically sense and overcome obstacles on its path. It contains a
        Arduino to process the data, and Ultrasonic sensors to detect the
        obstacles on its path. Obstacle avoidance is one of the most important
        aspects of mobile robotics. Without it, robot movement would be very
        restrictive and fragile. This project also presents a dynamic steering
        algorithm that ensures that the robot doesn't have to stop in front of an
        obstacle which allows the robot to navigate smoothly in an unknown
        environment, avoiding collisions. Almost all navigation robot demands some
        sort of obstacle detection, hence obstacle avoidance strategy is of most
        importance. Obstacle Avoidance Robot has a vast field of application. They
        can be used as services robots, for the purpose of household work and so
        many other indoor applications. Equally, they have great importance in
        scientific exploration and emergency rescue, there may be places that are
        dangerous for humans or even impossible for humans to reach directly, then
        we should use robots to help us. In those challenging environments, the
        robots need to gather information about their surroundings to avoid
        obstacles. Nowadays, even in ordinary environments, people require that
        robots to detect and avoid obstacles. For example, an industrial robot in
        a factory is expected to avoid workers so that it wont hurt them. In
        conclusion, obstacle avoidance is widely researched and applied in the
        world, and it is probable that most robots in the future should have an
        obstacle avoidance function..
